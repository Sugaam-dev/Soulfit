            Why Should You Get Your Yoga Teacher Training Course In Rishikesh?
            Answer is so simple.. Because it is the world capital of yoga. To
            give another solid reason which happened in the mid 1900s, Beatles
            came to Rishikesh in 1968 and stayed at Maharishi Mahesh Ashram. As
            the band explained, their stay at the ashram, in Rishikesh, was the
            band’s most productive period of their life in terms of songwriting.
            Rishikesh is a holy city which is settled on the foothills of
            Himalayas and home to Mother Ganges River. As city having its own
            spiritual vibes which come from ancient times as yoga was born here,
            with the combination of its stunning nature, it is a perfect
            destination for traditional and authentic yoga teacher training
            courses (YTTC). Rishikesh has been home to yogic practices since
            millennia via attracting many yogis, sages, saints. <br /> <br /> Now, could you
            stop for a second and imagine, waking up and opening your eyes to
            the Himalayas, hearing various sounds of birds, having a shower,
            walking by the Mother Ganges and heading onto your mat for your yoga
            class? Learning yoga and its philosophy from Indian Gurus (teachers)
            who have a strong background about all aspects of yoga.. Doesn’t it
            sound so peaceful and wonderful? <br /> <br /> In Western World, yoga is
            misunderstood and taught. Because of physical concerns or increased
            popularity of yoga, people only focus on the physical aspects of
            yoga which is asanas. However, yoga teacher training courses in
            Rishikesh offers more than its physical aspects because yoga is not
            only physical practice. As you deeply study yogic philosophy,
            breathing techniques, ancient texts etc, you will improve yourself
            more in your yogic practice. It is not something that you should
            practice only 1 or 2 hours a day but rather it is something that you
            should pursue as your life style. <br /> <br /> To experience yoga teacher
            training course (YTTC) in Rishikesh is solely life changing. Create
            your own opportunity to join our yoga teacher training courses in
            Rishikesh. Your life will never be the same. Let the peace shine
            through your heart! We are waiting for you on the mat by Mother
            Ganges.
